# End-to-end smoke test for the headless server.
#
# Launches dist-headless/main/index.js on an ephemeral port + localhost,
# parses the [web-client] URL out of stdout, then delegates to
# scripts/web-smoke.mjs and scripts/ws-smoke.mjs for HTTP + WS
# validation. Finally SIGTERMs the server and confirms it exits within
# 5s (no zombies).
#
# Run locally:  pnpm run build:headless && bash scripts/smoke-headless.sh
# Run in CI:    same — invoked from .github/workflows/ci.yml.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = all checks passed; non-zero = a check failed (the
# server log is dumped to stderr on URL-parse failure).
