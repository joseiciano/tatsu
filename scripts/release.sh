#
# Release script for Tatsu.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/release.sh <version>
# Example: ./scripts/release.sh 1.0.1
#
# Steps (all local — no build, no publish):
#   1. Preflight (clean tree, on main, gh authed, claude CLI present)
#   2. Bump package.json + pnpm-lock.yaml
#   3. Rewrite README download links
#   4. Generate site/public/releases.html entry via Claude
#   5. Write release-notes/v<ver>.md (read by the CI workflows)
#   6. Interactive confirm
#   7. Commit "Release v<ver>", tag, push main + tag
#
# That tag push triggers .github/workflows/release.yml, which runs one
# `create-release` job (reading the body from release-notes/v<ver>.md
# committed in step 5) followed by three parallel build jobs
# (build-mac / build-linux / build-headless) that all depend on the
# create. dmg/zip/blockmap/latest-mac.yml + AppImage/deb/latest-linux.yml
# + tatsu-server tarballs all attach to the same release.
#
# Recovery if a build job fails after tag push:
#   - Single job failed (e.g. flaky notarization)? Re-run that job from
#     the Actions UI. create-release is idempotent on re-run (detects
#     the existing release and skips), so a partial replay works.
#   - Whole release is bad? Delete the tag + release:
#        gh release delete v<ver> --cleanup-tag
#        git tag -d v<ver>
#      Fix the underlying issue, then re-run this script with the same
#      version. Re-pushing the tag fires release.yml fresh.

The raw commit messages since the last release are in ${CHANGES_FILE} — read that file.

External contributors for this release are in ${CONTRIBUTORS_FILE} — read that file too. Each line is '#NN @login' for a PR authored by someone other than the release maintainer. If the file is empty or missing, there are no external contributors and you should skip the credit instructions below.

Read site/public/releases.html to understand the existing HTML structure and writing style,
then insert the new entry at the top of the releases list (right after the <!-- Releases -->
div opening, before the first existing release section). See the v2.9.3 entry for the canonical inline-credit and trailing-thanks pattern.

Rules:
- Match the exact HTML structure, CSS classes, and formatting of existing entries.
- The new <section class=\"release-section py-10\"> MUST include id=\"${TAG}\" (e.g. id=\"v1.2.3\") so it can be deep-linked from the in-app updater UI.
- The version <h2> MUST wrap its text in a self-link matching existing entries, e.g.: <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight\"><a href=\"#${TAG}\" class=\"release-anchor\">${TAG}<span class=\"anchor-icon\">🔗</span></a></h2>
- Rewrite commit messages into user-facing release notes. Write for users, not developers.
- Group under h4 headings: \"New features\", \"Improvements\", \"Fixes\" — only include sections that have content.
- Skip meta commits: version bumps, README updates, CI fixes, squash labels.
- A short 1-2 sentence headline summary in the <p> tag after the download link.
- Date format: \"${RELEASE_DATE}\".
- Download link points to: https://github.com/frenchie4111/harness/releases/tag/${TAG}
- For any <li> whose change corresponds to a PR listed in the contributors file, append an inline credit at the end of the <li>: <em class=\"text-neutral-500\">(thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/LOGIN\" class=\"text-amber-400/80 hover:text-amber-300\">@LOGIN</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/frenchie4111/harness/pull/NN\" class=\"text-amber-400/80 hover:text-amber-300\">#NN</a>)</em>. Match #NN to the PR number embedded in the original commit message.
- If the contributors file has any entries, end the .note-body div with a trailing <p class=\"text-neutral-400 text-sm mt-6 leading-relaxed\"> that reads 'Huge thanks to @user1, @user2, and @userN for their contributions to this release.' — each @user wrapped in <a href=\"https://github.com/LOGIN\" class=\"text-amber-400/80 hover:text-amber-300\">@LOGIN</a>, ordered alphabetically, with Oxford-comma 'and' formatting.
- Do NOT modify any existing release entries. Only add the new one." \
