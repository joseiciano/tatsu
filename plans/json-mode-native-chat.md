# JSON-mode native chat — backlog

> **Historical note**: this document describes the legacy json-claude runtime (JsonClaudeManager, ApprovalBridge, subprocess/jsonl architecture) which was removed in favor of the ACP chat runtime. For current architecture, see `plans/acp-claude.md`.

Phase 1 (MCP permission bridge) and Phase 2 (json-claude tab MVP) are
shipped in PR #21 and merged into this branch. This file is the live
backlog of what's left, organized so each item can be picked up in its
own worktree.

## What works today

### Subprocess / protocol
- `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json
  --include-partial-messages` per json-claude tab, behind
  `settings.jsonModeClaudeTabs` (toggleable from the Experimental
  Settings section).
- The json-mode subprocess is the bundled `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
  native binary (pinned in `package.json`), spawned directly via
  `createRequire`-resolved path through the platform-specific
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-code-<platform>-<arch>` subpackage. xterm tabs
  still use the user's PATH `claude`. `settings.useSystemClaudeForJsonMode`
  (no UI; edit `config.json`) flips json-mode back to PATH for
  diagnostics. The bundled binary is unpacked from asar (216MB native
  Mach-O / ELF / PE per platform) so it can be exec'd at runtime.
- Session persistence via `--resume <sessionId>` on restart, plus
  on-disk transcript replay so the chat scrollback rehydrates after a
  full app restart. Replay dispatches a single `entriesSeeded` event
  so the chat appears in one render rather than ticking in.
- Mid-turn interrupt via stdin `{type:"control_request",
  request:{subtype:"interrupt"}}` — keeps the subprocess alive.
- Mid-session permission-mode change (`default` / `acceptEdits` /
  `plan`) via stdin `control_request` (subtype
  `set_permission_mode`) — does NOT abort the in-flight turn; the
  spawn-time flag is only consulted on a fresh respawn.
- Mid-turn user-message injection: typing while `busy=true` queues the
  message and writes it to stdin, rendered as a dashed/muted "queued"
  bubble with a cancel affordance until the next `result` resolves it.
- Restart action wired (`restartJsonClaude` = kill + start, preserves
  the session id so `--resume` rehydrates) and "Send to agent" works
  from ReviewScreen / DiffView / FileView.
- In-place swap between xterm and JSON-mode Claude tabs (right-click
  the tab), preserving the on-disk session via `--session-id`/`--resume`.
- Default tab type setting (`settings.defaultClaudeTabType`) — when
  JSON mode is enabled, choose whether new agent tabs default to xterm
  or JSON-mode Claude.
- Memory isolation via `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1` +
  `HARNESS_TERMINAL_ID` scrub so json-claude sessions don't pollute
  user memory or fire the user-scope status hooks.

### Permissions
- Per-tool approvals via the bundled stdio MCP server
  (`resources/permission-prompt-mcp.js`) → Unix domain socket →
  `ApprovalBridge` → `jsonClaude` slice → `<JsonClaudeApprovalCard />`.
  Allow / Allow with edits / Deny + interrupt-turn checkbox.
- "Allow {tool} this session" / "Allow edits this session" buttons on
  the approval card record a per-session auto-allow set
  (`sessionToolApprovals`); the bridge resolves matching requests
  directly without the UI round-trip. Set survives kill+respawn but
  not app restarts.
- "Always allow…" button on the approval card opens an inline picker
  of self-generated rule suggestions (narrow → medium → broad scoped)
  derived from the tool name + input by `src/shared/permission-patterns.ts`
  — Bash gets `<head> <arg1>:*` / `<head>:*` / `*`, file tools get
  exact path / parent-dir glob / any, WebFetch gets URL / domain / any,
  MCP and other tools get the bare name. Selecting a rule resolves the
  approval with `updatedPermissions: [{type:'addRules', rules: [<rule>],
  destination:'localSettings'}]`, which Claude Code persists into the
  worktree's `.claude/settings.local.json`. Future matching tool calls
  in any session in that worktree are pre-approved before they reach
  the MCP bridge, across app restarts.
- Optional LLM-based auto-reviewer (`settings.autoApprovePermissions`,
  Experimental section). Routes each pending approval through a Haiku
  oneshot first; auto-resolves when Haiku returns approve, falls
  through to the UI otherwise. Decisions logged to debug.log.
  Hardcoded deny-list (push/delete/sudo/credentials/Slack-or-Gmail-
  send) bypasses Haiku and always asks the human.
- Tool cards show audit badges when an approval was auto-resolved —
  `auto-approved by haiku · <reason>` for the LLM path,
  `allowed by session policy` for the per-session set.
- `harness-control` MCP server is co-injected alongside
  `harness-permissions` so worktree/browser/shell tools work inside
  json-claude sessions.

### Chat UI
- Markdown rendering via `react-markdown` + `rehype-highlight`, scoped
  `.markdown` CSS so the global preflight reset doesn't strip
  bullets / heading sizes / code-block padding.
- Partial-message streaming. Assistant text appears progressively;
  deltas are coalesced (~30ms) in `JsonClaudeManager` before dispatching
  to avoid per-token re-renders. Tool calls render a "preparing call…"
  placeholder card the moment `content_block_start` arrives so the UI
  doesn't look frozen while the input streams. The consolidated
  `assistant` event reconciles the entry by replacing its blocks via
  `assistantEntryFinalized`.
- Extended-thinking blocks render as collapsible cards in the chat
  flow (default expanded while streaming, auto-collapsed once the
  message finalizes). Empty-period spinner row covers the dead time
  between user-send and the first stream event, and inter-turn gaps.
- Compaction surfaces as a centered system-style banner ("conversation
  compacted · N messages summarized"); both autocompact and `/compact`
  paths are recognized via the `compact_boundary` content-block type
  in the live stream and the synthetic `system` records in the JSONL
  on seed.
- Per-tool cards (Read / Edit / MultiEdit / Write / Bash / Grep / Glob /
  TodoWrite) with a generic fallback for everything else. Tool calls
  collapsed by default, expandable on click. Compact one-line headers
  (`Read foo/bar.ts`, `Bash: npm test`, `Edit foo.ts (+12 −3)`).
  Errored tool calls show an "error" badge.
- Edit / MultiEdit cards render a real unified diff with syntax
  highlighting (same `highlight.js` instance used for fenced code).
  Read cards render the file with syntax highlighting + line-number
  gutter, dimming non-`offset`/`limit` lines when a range was requested.
- Auto-stick scroll: chat pins to the bottom when streaming and the
  user is near the bottom; releases the pin the moment the user
  scrolls up so backreading isn't fought by new tokens.
- Mobile/narrow-viewport word-wrap fix: `.markdown` uses
  `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, user bubbles use `break-words`, the chat
  scroll container is `overflow-x-hidden`. Long unbroken tokens
  (URLs, hashes) no longer push the page wider than the viewport.
- Consecutive tool calls grouped into a collapsible block between
  assistant text turns. Group header shows count + tool name list.
  Auto-expands when any tool inside has a pending approval; auto-
  collapses again once all the pending approvals resolve, unless the
  user manually toggled the chevron mid-flight.
- harness-control MCP tool calls (`mcp__harness-control__*`) get the
  brand amber→red→purple gradient treatment — thin top bar, gradient
  tool name, and animated flow on hover — matching the Add worktree
  button. The mangled `mcp__harness-control__` prefix is stripped from
  the displayed name.
- Bottom statusline (Claude TUI style): connection state + thinking
  indicator on the left, interrupt + permission-mode chip on the right.
- Sub-agent nesting. `parent_tool_use_id` on assistant entries is
  persisted through the slice, so when Claude spawns a Task agent the
  sub-agent's chronological work (text, thinking, tool calls, results)
  renders inside an expandable `TaskCard` rather than flattening into
  the parent transcript. Recursive — a sub-agent that itself calls
  Task gets a nested TaskCard for its grandchildren. Same chevron +
  chrome treatment as ToolGroup so it reads as another level of the
  same nesting design. Auto-expands while the Task is in flight or any
  descendant has a pending approval; auto-collapses once everything
  resolves unless the user manually toggled.

### Composer
- Slash-command autocomplete: typing `/` pops a ranked picker over the
  session's `slashCommands` (sourced from claude's `system/init`),
  with pre-baked descriptions for built-ins (`/clear`, `/compact`,
  `/cost`, …).
- `@`-mention file picker: typing `@` pops a fuzzy-search picker over
  worktree files; selecting inserts the path into the message.
- Image paste + drag-drop attachments. Pasted/dropped images are
  written to a per-session attachments dir and embedded in the user
  message as `(image attached at <path>)` so the model can Read/Bash
  the file. Thumbnails render in the chat history via a lazy
  `jsonClaude:readAttachmentImage` IPC.

### Cost & usage
- Per-session token + dollar usage rolled up from `result.usage`
  events in the stream into the existing `costs` slice. Surfaces in
  the same per-tab + per-worktree cost panel the xterm path uses.

### Other
- Sidebar/tab status dots derived from the `jsonClaude` slice
  (processing / waiting / needs-approval). The deriver scopes per-event
  and dedups against last-derived status, so streaming tokens don't
  fan out into N status dispatches across N open chats.
- Mobile/web client renders json-claude tabs (textarea uses 16px to
  avoid iOS auto-zoom).
- Integration test that spawns real `claude -p` and exercises the
  approval round-trip.

## Backlog — pick one per worktree

Each entry is sized for an independent branch + PR. Listed roughly in
descending user-visible value.

### High value

#### Sub-agent nesting
`assistant` events carry `parent_tool_use_id` when nested. Today
sub-agent activity flattens into the parent transcript and looks
chaotic. Want: nest child entries under the parent Task tool card.
Renderer-side grouping is ready to consume this — only the manager/
slice plumbing for `parent_tool_use_id` is still missing: persist the
field on `JsonClaudeChatEntry` (or on each assistant entry) in
`src/shared/state/json-claude.ts`, populate it in
`src/main/json-claude-manager.ts` from the stream-json
`parent_tool_use_id` field, and the JsonModeChat grouping pass can
bucket child entries under the parent Task card.

### Medium value

#### `result.usage` rate-limit warnings + MCP auth-needed surface
We drop `rate_limit_event` silently and only partially consume
`system/init`. Surface rate-limit warnings inline in the chat, and an
MCP-server-status row for `system/init.mcp_servers[]` entries that
report `needs-auth` (with a re-auth CTA where relevant).

#### Mid-session model switch
Permission-mode cycling now uses a stdin `control_request` to flip
mid-turn without a respawn. Models don't have an equivalent control
request, so the model picker still has to kill + respawn with
`--resume --model X` (matches the original cycle pattern). Add a
picker in the statusline.

#### Hook-event observability
`--include-hook-events` lets us see auto-approved tool calls (Reads,
safe Bash) that the classifier never sends to the approval bridge.
Render them in a dimmer style — no approval needed but useful for
"what did Claude actually do this turn".

#### Per-worktree / per-repo override of the global `defaultClaudeTabType`
The global setting (`settings.defaultClaudeTabType`) is wired today
but a per-worktree or per-repo override would let a user opt one
specific repo into JSON mode without flipping it for everything.
Likely lives alongside the existing per-repo `.harness.json`.

### Backlog follow-ups from partial-message streaming

- `input_json_delta` for `tool_use` blocks. The partial-streaming PR
  shows a "preparing call…" placeholder card on `content_block_start`
  so the UI doesn't look frozen, but the actual tool input still pops
  in all-at-once when the consolidated `assistant` event arrives.
  Picking this up means accumulating the json fragments per tool_use
  block and progressively populating the per-tool cards as fields come
  in (e.g. `file_path` appears, then `offset`/`limit`).

### Smaller / polish

- Multi-tool cards still missing: WebFetch (URL preview),
  WebSearch (hit list), NotebookEdit, BashOutput (background polling).
- Code-block "copy" button on assistant text.
- `Cmd+F` search over chat scrollback.
- "Jump to bottom" affordance when paused on scroll-up.
- Honor `terminalFontFamily` / `terminalFontSize` settings for
  json-claude (today uses default sans).
- Tab-bar / mobile-app gain a way to *create* a json-claude tab (today
  must be done from desktop's shift-click affordance).
- Surface a `description` for tool calls when Claude provides one
  (rolled back with the suggestions work — the field is empty on the
  MCP path same as suggestions, gated on the same Anthropic-side fix).

### Testing / robustness

- Plain Allow path coverage in the integration test (regressed once;
  add a permanent guard).
- Deny-path coverage (only allow-with-edits is covered today).
- Auth-required / subprocess-crash recovery UI ("session ended; click
  to restart" instead of just `exited` text).
- Rate-limit error display with retry guidance.

### Phase 4 (maybe never) — full replacement

Same as before: only consider once the items above are done AND dual-
mode reveals it's strictly better. This means deprecating xterm and
solving:
  - `/login` / OAuth re-auth flow (currently TUI-only).
  - Every future Claude Code feature becoming a Harness porting task.
  - Stability guarantees on the stream-json protocol and the
    `--permission-prompt-tool` flag, which Anthropic still hasn't
    given.

## Ship as default — blockers and wants

What's required to flip `settings.defaultClaudeTabType` from `'xterm'`
to `'json-claude'` for new users without immediate rollback.

### P0 — must-have before flipping the default

- **Subprocess-crash recovery UI.** Today a crashed json-claude
  subprocess just leaves the tab showing `exited`. New users will hit
  this and not know what to do. Want a clear "session ended; click to
  restart" affordance, with the kill+respawn already wired
  (`restartJsonClaude` exists).
- **Rate-limit error display.** Surface `rate_limit_event` and
  `result` errors with retry guidance instead of dropping silently.
  Right now the chat just appears stuck.
- **`/login` / OAuth re-auth path** — or, at minimum, a clear "switch
  this tab to xterm to re-auth" CTA when auth fails. TUI-only `/login`
  means default users have no recovery path on token expiry today.
- **Pinned-Claude-version smoke test in CI.**
  `--permission-prompt-tool` is `.hideHelp()` and could rename without
  notice. Default users would break first. Run a smoke test on every
  Claude Code dependency bump.
### P1 — strong wants (not strict blockers, but noticeable gaps)

- **Sub-agent nesting.** Already in High-value backlog. Without it,
  Task-using turns look chaotic — sub-agent reads/edits flatten into
  the parent transcript. Definitely visible to a user trying json mode
  for the first time.
- **Mid-session model switch.** Picker in the statusline. Listed in
  Medium value below.
- **`input_json_delta` for tool_use blocks.** Tool input progressively
  pops in instead of one big jump. UX polish, but visible.

### P2 — polish that won't block the default flip

Code-block copy button, Cmd+F search, Jump-to-bottom, terminal
font-family/size, mobile/tab-bar create-json-claude-tab,
multi-tool cards (WebFetch/WebSearch/NotebookEdit/BashOutput/Task),
hook-event observability, per-worktree override of the default tab
type.

### Already in good shape

Performance is no longer a concern — the recent perf pass cut event-
loop spikes ~10x and brought streaming-chat re-render cost to O(1) per
token regardless of how many json-mode chats are open (see
`json-status-deriver-dedup-and-scope`, `cascade-detection-and-architecture-docs`,
`changed-files-watcher-not-poll`, `branch-commits-watcher-and-cascade-tuning`,
`watched-query-cache-for-panels`). Baseline polish (cost meter, real
diff cards, syntax-highlighted Read, scroll-stick, mobile word-wrap)
is shipped.

## Standing risks

- **`--permission-prompt-tool` is `.hideHelp()`.** json-mode runs
  against the bundled `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` (currently 2.1.126,
  pinned in `package.json`) so a global `npm i -g` of a breaking version
  can't surprise users. The integration test in
  `src/main/approval-bridge.test.ts` exercises the round trip on every
  vitest run; a future CI workflow can run that against the pinned dep
  to gate dep bumps. xterm tabs still hit the user's PATH `claude` and
  carry the same risk for that surface.
- **Stream-json schema drift.** `PermissionResult.updatedInput` was
  optional through 2.1.109, became required in 2.1.114 — we got bit
  once (the "plain Allow" regression). Same kind of drift could land
  on any field.
- **MCP path missing fields the TUI gets.** `permission_suggestions`
  + `description` are the known cases. There may be others.
  `--include-hook-events` may also expose differences worth auditing.

## Rewind

Right-click any **assistant** message → **Rewind to here**. Keeps
the clicked message (it becomes "the last thing the agent said")
and drops every entry that came after it. Leaves the user at that
point in the conversation with an empty composer, ready to type a
new response.

### Where the conversation lives

Two synced copies: **Slice (RAM)** at
`JsonClaudeSession.entries` (`src/shared/state/json-claude.ts:134`) —
stripped from the wire snapshot (`stripJsonClaudeEntries`, `:366`),
lazy-fetched via `jsonClaude:getEntries` (`src/main/index.ts:2588`).
**Session jsonl (disk, claude-code-owned)** at
`~/.claude/projects/<cwd-encoded>/<sessionId>.jsonl`
(`src/main/json-claude-manager.ts:230`, `:429`) — the source
`--resume <sessionId>` rehydrates from, replayed into the slice by
`seedFromTranscript` (`:225`). Each turn-line carries
`{uuid, parentUuid, type, message}`; bookkeeping types
(`queue-operation`, `attachment`, `last-prompt`, `custom-title`,
`agent-name`) interleave but aren't chat turns.

**Identifying the assistant turn.** Live entries get the API message
id from `message_start`; seeded entries get it from
`parsed.message.id`. Both write it to `apiMessageId` on the slice
entry. This is the key the rewind path uses: a single assistant
turn is one API call but the on-disk jsonl writes one line per
content block (thinking, tool_use, text) and they all share the
same `message.id`. Truncation cuts after the LAST jsonl line
carrying that id, so the entire turn is preserved as a unit.
`transcriptUuid` is still populated on seeded entries as a stable
per-line key but isn't currently used at rewind time — a
position-based cut would land too early because the slice can group
multi-block turns into one entry while the jsonl can't.

### Subprocess lifecycle

`JsonClaudeManager` (`src/main/json-claude-manager.ts:197`) owns one
instance per session id. `create()` (`:364`) spawns with
`--resume <id>` if the jsonl exists (`:432`), else `--session-id <id>`.
`kill()` (`:792`) ends stdin + SIGTERM. No first-class restart —
pattern is `kill()` → `startJsonClaudeSession()`
(`src/main/index.ts:801`), which re-seeds from disk and respawns.
Mid-turn controls (`interrupt`, `set_permission_mode`) ride stdin
`control_request` frames (`:759`, `:831`).

### Resume semantics — truncate on disk, don't replay

`--resume` rehydrates Messages-API state from the jsonl; does **not**
re-execute turns. The bundled binary also exposes `--fork-session`
(verified in `claude --help`) — useful in Phase 3.

**Decision: truncate the jsonl in place.** Truncation is $0 in
tokens, deterministic (keeps original assistant responses byte-for-
byte so the cache hits on the next user turn), ~30 LOC. Replay-via-
stream-json would re-run N assistant turns ($$ tokens-out + cache
bust). Format-drift risk is the same risk `seedFromTranscript`
already eats.

### Truncation point selection

The menu only appears on assistant rows. The cut keeps the clicked
assistant message and drops every entry sequenced after it — the
jsonl now ends with that assistant message, which is the natural
"ready for next user turn" state. `--resume` rehydrates and waits
for input.

If the clicked message is mid-stream (`isPartial`), the IPC handler
interrupts and waits for the `result` boundary before reading the
jsonl so the file is quiesced. Whatever streamed in by that point
is preserved.

**System / hook-injected records** (non-turn jsonl rows like
`attachment`, `queue-operation`) aren't user-targetable (no chat row
renders them) and pass through the cut when they predate it.

### In-flight state to cancel

| In-flight | Where | Cleanup |
|---|---|---|
| Streaming assistant (`busy`, `partial != null`) | `JsonClaudeManager.partial` (`:49`, `:1328`) | `interrupt()` (`:759`); wait ≤1500ms for next `result` |
| Pending approval round-trip | `ApprovalBridge.pendingResponses` (`src/main/approval-bridge.ts:78`) | New `cancelPendingForSession(sessionId)` — same loop as `stopSession` (`:122`), without tearing the server down |
| Tool running through MCP (approved, awaiting result) | Untracked; lives inside the subprocess agent loop | Subsumed by interrupt; long-running Bash etc. completes inside the subprocess, result discarded after `kill()` |
| Queued user messages (`isQueued`) | `entries[i].isQueued` (`src/shared/state/json-claude.ts:73`) | Already on stdin; absorbed by the truncation pass |

Order: **interrupt → await `result` (≤1500ms) → deny pendings →
kill → truncate jsonl → respawn**. The wait guarantees a quiesced
jsonl.

### End-to-end flow

1. User right-clicks an assistant message.
2. Inline context menu pops (positioned `<div>` like
   `src/renderer/components/TerminalPanel.tsx:199-207`). One
   destructive item, `RotateCcw` icon: "Rewind to here · drops
   this message + everything after."
3. Click. No confirm — Phase 2's Undo affordance is the safety net.
4. Renderer fires `jsonClaude:rewindTo(sessionId, entryId)` — new
   IPC handler beside `:2469-2650`.
5. Main: interrupt → await `result` → deny pendings → call into
   the manager.
6. `JsonClaudeManager.rewindTo` reads the clicked entry's
   `apiMessageId`, kills the subprocess, calls
   `truncateTranscriptAfterMessage` (scan jsonl for the LAST line
   whose inner `message.id` matches, write tmp + atomic rename,
   original backed up as `<sessionId>.jsonl.rewind-<ts>.bak`).
7. Force-reseed the slice by calling `parseTranscriptEntries` on the
   freshly-truncated jsonl and dispatching `jsonClaude/entriesSeeded`
   with the result. The slice and jsonl are now identical.
8. `startJsonClaudeSession(sessionId, worktreePath)` (`:801`):
   `seedFromTranscript` no-ops (entries already populated by step 7),
   `create()` respawns with `--resume`. The next user message starts
   a fresh turn from this restored state.

**New events:** none — `jsonClaude/entriesTruncated` was added in
the slice for the prior design but is unused now. `entriesSeeded`
(pre-existing) handles the slice replacement. New entry field:
`apiMessageId`.

### UI surface

In `src/renderer/components/JsonModeChat.tsx:540-810`, the entry
render loop emits multiple rows per assistant entry (text, thinking
cards, tool cards). The top-level `groupedItems.map` wraps each
item in a div that only carries `onContextMenu` when the source row
is part of an assistant entry — right-clicking a user bubble or a
system card falls through to the browser default.

**No reusable context-menu primitive exists** — `TerminalPanel`
inlines a positioned `<div>` (`:237-280`). Inline the same pattern;
extract a `<ContextMenu>` only when a third caller appears. Menu
item: destructive red, `RotateCcw` (already imported, `:24`), label
"Rewind to here", muted subtitle "drops everything after this".
Disabled with explainer when:
- the assistant row is the latest entry (nothing after to drop),
- the assistant row is from a sub-agent (`parentToolUseId` set),
- the entry sits before any `compact_boundary`,
- the session has exited.

### Token / cache cost

50-turn convo rewound to turn 30: rewind itself = **0 tokens** (no
model call); next user turn's prompt prefix is identical bytes to
"as if turn 31 never happened," so Anthropic's prompt cache hits on
the full prefix — cost ≈ a normal continuation turn. Replay-via-
stream-json would re-run 30 assistant turns (×$ output + fresh-
session cache bust). Order-of-magnitude difference; truncation wins.

### Edge cases + open questions

- **Rewind on the very first assistant message** = drop every
  subsequent exchange but keep the opening user/assistant pair.
  Disabled if that message is also the latest entry (nothing to drop).
- **Rewind across a `compact_boundary`.** Truncating into pre-
  compaction history doesn't help — claude won't see those raw
  turns on resume (compaction replaced them). Phase 1 **disables
  the menu on assistant entries that sit before any
  `compact_boundary`** with a tooltip; Phase 3 could spike
  truncating compaction state.
- **Mid-session model switch.** Each jsonl turn carries its model;
  the post-rewind turn runs on the session's current model. No
  special case.
- **Tool-only assistant message (no text block).** Tool-group card
  carries the entry id to the menu; truncation drops normally.
- **Scrolled-out-of-view message.** Right-click fires where the user
  clicked; auto-stick scroll carries the view to the new tail.
- **Sub-agent turns (`parentToolUseId` set).** Can't usefully
  rewind a sub-agent in isolation — the parent Task's tool_result
  depends on the full run. Menu is disabled on those entries;
  rewinding the parent Task assistant entry drops the whole
  sub-agent run as a unit.
- **Open — concurrent rewinds from two viewers.** Per-session async
  lock on the truncate path in `JsonClaudeManager`.

### Phasing

**Phase 1 — MVP via on-disk truncation.** `transcriptUuid` plumbing
(or ordinal fallback), `jsonClaude:rewindTo` IPC,
`JsonClaudeManager.truncateAt`,
`ApprovalBridge.cancelPendingForSession`,
`jsonClaude/entriesTruncated` event + reducer + test, inline
context-menu wired only on assistant rows in `JsonModeChat`,
disabled state for `compact_boundary` / `parentToolUseId` entries
and exited sessions. `.bak` written aside, no UI yet.

**Phase 2 — Undo affordance.** Post-rewind toast "Rewound · Undo"
(~10s lifetime); click restores from `.bak`, kills + respawns,
re-seeds. Wire is rewind in reverse. Persist the `.bak` reference
on the session so multi-client + reload preserves the affordance
until expiry.

**Phase 3 — `--fork-session` for a pristine original.** Fork
instead of mutating the jsonl; original untouched. Requires a
session-id migration in the panes slice (non-trivial). Defer until
Phase 1+2 are field-proven and `--fork-session`'s semantics are
better documented.

Each phase is independently shippable: Phase 1 delivers the user
feature; Phase 2 layers safety; Phase 3 hardens the disk story
without changing the UX.
