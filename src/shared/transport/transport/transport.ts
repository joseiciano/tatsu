// Transport abstraction — the seam between main and renderer.
//
// Today there's exactly one implementation pair: ElectronServerTransport
// (main side, wraps ipcMain + webContents.send) and ElectronClientTransport
// (renderer side, wraps ipcRenderer). In the future, additional pairs
// (WebSocket, SSH stdio, …) can slot in without touching any call site
// above this layer — the store, slices, and window.api surface are all
// transport-agnostic.
//
// Three kinds of traffic flow across a transport:
//
// 1. State events — the authoritative mutation stream. Main's Store
//    dispatches a StateEvent, the server transport broadcasts it to every
//    connected client, and each client's mirror applies the SAME shared
//    reducer. This is the backbone of the 2.0 architecture.
//
// 2. Requests — one-shot RPC calls (mirror of ipcMain.handle /
//    ipcRenderer.invoke). Named by a channel string; args and return
//    value are arbitrary JSON-serializable data. All requests are async;
//    there is intentionally no sync variant so future non-Electron
//    transports don't have to invent blocking round-trips.
//
// 3. Signals — fire-and-forget pushes in either direction (mirror of
//    webContents.send / ipcRenderer.send). Used for high-frequency
//    streams (PTY bytes) and low-level fire-and-forget notifications
//    (menu-triggered events, pty:write). No return value, no delivery
//    guarantee beyond what the underlying transport provides.
//
// Server-side request/signal handlers receive a ConnectionContext as
// their first argument. The `clientId` is a server-assigned UUID that
// stays stable for the life of a connection (one per BrowserWindow, one
// per WebSocket). It lets main-side handlers gate on "who's calling" —
// e.g. only the terminal's current controller's pty:write / pty:resize
// are honoured; other clients watch as spectators. Client-side signal
// handlers don't receive a ctx because the server identity is implicit.
